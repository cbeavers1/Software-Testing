# Software-Testing

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  Ensuring that all methods, logic, or code is tested and/or put through a conditional evaluation will make certain my projects are functional and secure. 
  
* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  Comparing the needs of a user to the technical possibilities of software can help determine the requirmenet in software engineering terms. Determining the user's needed outcome
  can establish a starting point and working backwards we can find a software solution that is capable of producing the required outcome.
  
* How do I approach designing software?

  From a user's perspective. Depending on the needs of the software, approaching the design of the software from a user's perspective can shed light
  on aspects you may not notice from a developers position. Understanding how the system needs to work and what the system is used to accomplish is important to
  knowing how software should be developed.
